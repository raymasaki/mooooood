# Mooooood

http://mooooood.herokuapp.com/

Mooooood is a generative infographic built with Ruby on Rails. The idea was to create a visualization of users' feelings in an ambient way.  

### Technologies Used
- Ruby on Rails: For backend and data-fetching
- jQuery: For most of the data plotting
- Velocity.js: Animation framework
- WOW.js: Library for scroll-triggered animations

### Approach
- Started by going straight to UX and wireframes
- Once I settled on the overall layout and interaction, I made ERD diagrams
- Built the backend in Rails
- Once all the endpoints were set up worked on the front-end with jQuery
- Added additional front-end touches with Velocity and WOW

### Unsolved Problems
- WOW is really unpredictable, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't (caching problem?)
- I didn't add authentication and validation
- Probably should've added flashes to make the UX more clear
- Initially I had a really ambitious idea for using Stellar.js and having parallaxing datapoints
